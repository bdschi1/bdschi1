# 🏛️ pm-to-ai | Institutional AI Alignment & Evaluation Lab

**$750M Peak AUM Portfolio Manager (Sigma Capital (Point72)/Balyasny/Other) | MS Data Science (Northwestern '22) | CFA Charterholder (2001)**

`pm-to-ai` (Est. Nov 2025) is a specialized AI evaluation laboratory bridging the gap between elite discretionary judgment and the technical requirements of LLM alignment. We specialize in **Dynamic Conviction & Portfolio Frameworks**—evaluating models on their ability to build, manage, and risk-mitigate institutional Equity Long/Short books.


## 💎 The pm-to-ai Advantage

We translate "Multi-Strat" rigor into machine-readable ground truth, focusing on the "Cost of Error" in high-turnover environments where the goal is optimizing **Slugging Percentage** and portfolio-level risk-adjusted returns.

* **Full-Cycle Portfolio Management:** 20+ years of institutional experience across the L/S lifecycle: **building** thematic books, **managing** factor exposures, **trading** execution, and implementing **complete risk frameworks** at the **$750M+ AUM** level (Point72, Balyasny).
* **Cross-Regime Pattern Recognition:** Managed institutional capital through the Dot-com bust, 9/11, GFC, EU Debt Crisis, COVID-19, and the 2022 inflationary regime. We evaluate if models recognize shifting market "rules" or succumb to recency bias.
* **Regulatory & Primary Research Depth:** Extensive FDA regulatory understanding and active **FOIA user**. We verify the integrity of the information chain from molecular genetics (PhD-level coursework, OSU) to manufacturing and regulatory filings.
* **Modern Deep Learning Expertise:** MS in Data Science (Northwestern '22), specializing in **Modeling and Analytics**. Technical capstone focused on **LSTM Architectures** for biotech stock prediction.
* **Advanced LLM Tooling & API Integration:** Power-user of **Claude (Project/Code)**, **Gemini (NotebookLM/Advanced)**, **OpenAI Pro**, and **Perplexity**. We utilize model-specific coding agents and local Python environments to benchmark reasoning traces across the frontier model spectrum (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o).
* **Async-First Infrastructure:** GitLab Certified Associate and Remote Foundations expert. We deliver high-fidelity evaluations and "documentation-first" workflows autonomously.

## 📂 Featured Evaluation Frameworks

### 🚀 [Healthcare PM LLM Evals](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/bdschi1/fin-eval-rubric)

**Focus:** *Auditable Scoring of Biotech & Clinical Reasoning*

* **Impact:** Scores models on their ability to flag "Conviction Killers"—primary research discrepancies or trial design flaws—and their subsequent impact on position sizing.
* **Engineering:** Modular Python implementation utilizing Pydantic for schema validation and `Weights & Biases` for observability.

### 🧪 [Equity Research Scorer](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/bdschi1/equity-research-scorer)

**Focus:** *Automated Benchmarking of Investment Theses*

* **Impact:** Quantifies the quality of LLM-generated research against institutional standards like variant view strength, bear case quality, and mosaic strategy.

## 🎯 Strategic Value for AI Labs

`pm-to-ai` provides AI researchers and platforms (Mercor, Turing, Scale AI) with high-fidelity feedback for specialized model alignment:

1. **Portfolio Logic Verification:** Training models to understand how individual security catalysts interact with broader portfolio risk metrics (Net/Gross, Factor tilt, Liquidity).
2. **Bayesian Conviction Updates:** Evaluating a model's ability to update conviction and **trade** around a position based on conflicting primary source data and quantitative variables.
3. **Regime Change Detection:** Stress-testing models on their ability to identify shifts in market macro-drivers and adjust fundamental assumptions accordingly.
4. **Adversarial Testing (Red Teaming):** Identifying where models succumb to "Consensus-Hugging" or fail to recognize the "Unknown Unknowns" in complex market regimes.
