### 🔭 Research & datasets

Beyond the code, I am curating data to improve how LLMs handle financial nuance.

* **`financial-cot-dataset`**: Building a "Gold Standard" dataset for financial logic (EBITDA adjustments, "Kill Criteria" execution) to improve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).
* **`earnings-call-interrogator`**: Prototyping an NLP engine to detect "Non-Answers" and linguistic evasion in management transcripts.
