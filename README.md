# Hi there 👋

## Investment Professional & Python Developer

Bridging the gap between **Institutional Finance** and **Production-Grade AI**.
I focus on translating discretionary investment logic into reproducible, autonomous software agents.

---

## 🏛️ Core Applications (The “Buy Side” Stack)

Tools designed to automate and augment the institutional investment process.

---

### **The Long/Short Arena (Deep Reasoning)**

**View Repository**

An autonomous multi-agent system where **Bull** and **Bear PMs** debate research documents, adjudicated by a **CIO agent**.

**The Alpha**
Mitigates confirmation bias by forcing models to generate mutually exclusive deep-reasoning chains.

**Key Tech:**
Multi-Agent Systems, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Streamlit, OpenAI API

---

### **The AI Investment Committee (Qualitative)**

**View Repository**

An automated **Digital Portfolio Manager** that reads, grades, and validates investment research notes against a standardized rubric.

**The Alpha**
Quantifies the *variant view* in unstructured text and detects consensus-hugging.

**Key Tech:**
Pydantic (Structured Outputs), OpenAI (GPT-4o), SEC & Yahoo APIs

---

### **Backtest Factor Clinic (Quantitative)**

**View Repository**

A modular clinic for validating investment factors before they touch live capital.

**The Alpha**
Prevents overfitting by subjecting signals to regime changes, decay analysis, and transaction-cost stress tests.

**Key Tech:**
Python (Pandas, NumPy), Vectorbt, Statistical Analysis

---

## 🧬 AI Engineering & Ops (The “Model” Stack)

Infrastructure for creating, training, and vetting financial-domain models.

---

### **Financial RLHF Studio (Data Engine)**

**View Repository**

A **human-in-the-loop** labeling interface for capturing domain expertise to train financial LLMs.

**Workflow**
Generates *Draft vs. Expert* pairs to create **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** datasets.

**Goal**
Solve the “generic finance” problem by capturing institutional nuance for fine-tuning.

---

### **Async Model Trainer (Infrastructure)**

**View Repository**

A production-grade microservices architecture for scalable LLM fine-tuning.

**Architecture**
Decouples the **Control Plane** (FastAPI / Streamlit) from the **Compute Plane** (GPU workers) via a Redis message broker.

**Key Tech:**
Celery (Async Queues), FastAPI, Unsloth (LLaMA-3 Optimization), Docker Compose

---

### **Dynamic Thesis Vetter (Agentic RAG)**

**View Repository**

An **active interviewer** agent that interrogates investment memos rather than summarizing them.

**Workflow**
Identifies logical gaps → generates probing questions → searches source documents to test robustness.

**Key Tech:**
LangGraph (State Management), Advanced RAG, Dynamic Prompting
