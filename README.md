# 🏛️ pm-to-ai | Institutional AI Alignment & Evaluation Lab

**Founded by former long/short Portfolio Manager and buyside Equity Analyst (1998-2023) | 14 years as Senior PM | Sigma Capital (Point72 - 10 years)/Balyasny/Forstmann/others) managing $750M AUM (peak) | MS Data Science - Northwestern (2022) | CFA Charterholder (2001)**

`pm-to-ai` (formed 4Q 2025) is a specialized AI evaluation laboratory bridging the gap between elite discretionary judgment and the technical requirements of LLM alignment. We specialize in **Dynamic Conviction & Portfolio Frameworks**—evaluating models on their ability to build, manage, and risk-mitigate institutional Equity Long/Short books.

We provide the institutional 'buy-side' DNA required to bridge the gap between frontier AI architecture and elite financial reasoning.

## 💎 The pm-to-ai Advantage

We translate "Multi-Strat" rigor into machine-readable ground truth, focusing on the "Cost of Error" in high-turnover environments where the goal is optimizing **Equity Portfolio Performance**, **Risk Management Frameworks**, and **Critical Metrics** (e.g., Slugging Percentage, Volatility measures, and risk-adjusted returns).

* **Talent Development:** Deep track record of hiring and developing analyst teams (**n=4-6**) with zero turnover at premier multi-strat platforms. We apply this pedagogical rigor to evaluate AI "reasoning traces" and the scalability of automated research workflows.
* **Full-Spectrum Healthcare & Cross-Sector Expertise:** Deep fundamental specialization across the global Healthcare sector. Additionally, we bring experience in **ETF-based, custom basket and equity options based risk management**, evaluating how models utilize thematic and index products to dynamically pivot portfolio-level risk exposures.
* **Full-Cycle Portfolio Management:** 20+ years of institutional experience across the L/S lifecycle: **building** thematic books, **managing** factor exposures, **trading** execution (internal and external desks), and implementing **complete risk frameworks.**
* **Cross-Regime Pattern Recognition:** Managed institutional capital through the Dot-com bust, 9/11, GFC, EU Debt Crisis, COVID-19, and the 2022 inflationary regime. We evaluate if models recognize shifting market "rules" or succumb to recency bias.
* **Regulatory & Primary Research Depth:** Extensive FDA regulatory understanding and active **FOIA user**. We verify the integrity of the information chain from molecular biology (PhD-level coursework, OSU + future pm-to-ai PhD partners) to manufacturing and regulatory filings.
* Extensive generalist L/S and long-biased investing experience in recent years.
* **Modern Deep Learning Expertise:** MS in Data Science (Northwestern '22), specializing in **Modeling and Analytics**. Technical knowledge in _Transformer Architectures_ and _Agentic Workflows_. **Active 2025/26 certifications**: _LangChain Application Development, Generative AI with LLMs (AWS), and LLM Observability & Evaluation (Weights & Biases)._
* **Advanced LLM Tooling & API Integration:** Power-user of **Claude (Project/Code)**, **Gemini (NotebookLM/Advanced)**, **OpenAI Pro**, and **Perplexity**. We utilize model-specific coding agents and local Python environments to benchmark reasoning traces across the frontier model spectrum (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, OpenAI GPT-4o, and open souce models).

## 📂 Featured Evaluation Frameworks

### 🚀 [Healthcare PM LLM Evals](https://github.com/bdschi1/fin-eval-rubric)
**Focus:** *Auditable Scoring of Biotech & Clinical Reasoning*
* **Impact:** Translates 20+ years of healthcare PM experience into a programmatic "Evaluation Rubric." Designed to detect model hallucinations in clinical trial design and FDA regulatory paths—identifying "Conviction Killers" that generic benchmarks miss.
* **Engineering:** Modular Python implementation utilizing **Pydantic** for rigorous schema validation and **Weights & Biases (W&B)** for real-time observability and drift tracking.

### 🧪 [Equity Research Scorer](https://github.com/bdschi1/equity-research-scorer)
**Focus:** *Automated Benchmarking of Investment Theses*
* **Impact:** Quantifies LLM-generated research against institutional standards. Specifically benchmarks **Variant View** strength, **Bear Case** depth, and **Mosaic Theory** integration to ensure models produce differentiated alpha rather than generic consensus.
* **Engineering:** Features an automated scoring engine comparing model outputs against "Ground Truth" expert baselines using **Cosine Similarity** and custom financial **NLP heuristics**.

### 🏛️ [Thematic Unitization Lab](https://github.com/bdschi1/thematic-unitization)
**Focus:** *Evaluating Multi-Asset "Trade Packages" as Single Risk Units*
* **Impact:** Audits advanced PM reasoning where disparate tickers (Long/Short, Options, Hedges) are treated as a single "synthetic ticker." Critical for training models to navigate complex, real-world portfolios rather than isolated security analysis.
* **Engineering:** Orchestrated via **LangChain Agentic Workflows** to coordinate multi-source data retrieval and synthesize a unitized, conviction-weighted risk score.

## 🎯 Strategic Value for AI Labs

`pm-to-ai` provides AI researchers and platforms with high-fidelity feedback for specialized model alignment:

1. **Portfolio Logic Verification:** Training models to understand how individual security catalysts interact with broader portfolio risk metrics (Net/Gross, Factor tilt, Liquidity, Scenario bullpens).
2. **Conviction Updates:** Evaluating a model's ability to update conviction and **trade** around a position based on conflicting primary source data and quantitative variables.
3. **Regime Change Detection:** Stress-testing models on their ability to identify shifts in market macro-drivers and adjust fundamental assumptions accordingly.
4. **Adversarial Testing:** Identifying where models succumb to "Consensus-Hugging" or fail to recognize the "Unknown Unknowns" in complex market regimes.
5. **Thematic Trade Logic—evaluating a model’s ability to treat disparate positions (e.g. Fundamental Longs + Statistical Shorts + Options + ETFS + baskets) as a single risk-unit, rather than isolated tickers.**
