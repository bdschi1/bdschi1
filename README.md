# Hi there, I'm Brad 👋
### Investment Professional & Python Developer

Bridging the gap between **Institutional Finance** and **Production-Grade AI**. 
I focus on translating discretionary investment logic into reproducible, autonomous software agents.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 1. The AI Investment Committee (Qualitative)
**[View Repository](https://github.com/bdschi1/equity-research-scorer)**
An autonomous "Digital Portfolio Manager" that reads, grades, and validates investment research. 
* **Key Tech:** OpenAI (GPT-4o), Streamlit, Pydantic, SEC/Yahoo APIs.
* **The "Alpha":** Quantifies the "Variant View" in unstructured text.

#### 2. Backtest Factor Clinic (Quantitative)
**[View Repository](https://github.com/bdschi1/backtest-factor-clinic)**
A testing engine for validating investment factors before deployment.
* **The Problem:** Most backtests are overfitted and fail out-of-sample.
* **The Solution:** A modular "clinic" that stress-tests signal decay, regime changes, and transaction costs.
* **Key Tech:** Python (Pandas/NumPy), Vectorbt / Zipline (assuming), Statistical Analysis.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On (AI Training & Evaluation)

I am currently focused on **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** workflows to teach LLMs "Institutional Reasoning."

#### 1. `bull-bear-arena` (Adversarial Agents)
**Status:** *In Development*
A multi-agent system where two LLMs (Long vs. Short) debate the same 10-K data.
* **Goal:** Mitigate confirmation bias by forcing models to argue mutually exclusive theses.
* **Technique:** Adversarial prompting and "Judge-in-the-Loop" evaluation.

#### 2. `financial-cot-dataset` (Reasoning Chains)
**Status:** *Data Curation*
Building a "Gold Standard" dataset for financial logic and decision-making.
* **Goal:** Create high-quality **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** examples for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).
* **Focus:** Documenting the full investment lifecycle:
    * **Analyst Workflow:** Data normalization, EBITDA adjustments, and competitive benchmarking.
    * **PM Workflow:** Position sizing logic, risk budgeting, portfolio construction, and "Kill Criteria" execution.

#### 3. `earnings-call-interrogator` (Nuance Detection)
**Status:** *Prototyping*
An NLP engine designed to detect "Non-Answers" and linguistic evasion in management transcripts.
* **Goal:** Train models to identify subtext, hesitation, and sentiment shifts, rather than just summarizing text.
