Hi there, 👋

Investment Professional & Python Developer

Bridging the gap between Institutional Finance and Production-Grade AI.
I focus on translating discretionary investment logic into reproducible, autonomous software agents.

🏛️ Core Applications (The "Buy Side" Stack)

Tools designed to automate and augment the institutional investment process.

1. The Long/Short Arena (Deep Reasoning)

View Repository
An autonomous multi-agent system where a Bull and Bear PM debate research documents, adjudicated by a CIO agent.

The "Alpha": Mitigates confirmation bias by forcing models to generate mutually exclusive deep-reasoning chains.

Key Tech: Multi-Agent Systems, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Streamlit, OpenAI API.

2. The AI Investment Committee (Qualitative)

View Repository
An automated "Digital Portfolio Manager" that reads, grades, and validates investment research notes against a standardized rubric.

The "Alpha": Quantifies the "Variant View" in unstructured text and detects consensus-hugging.

Key Tech: Pydantic (Structured Outputs), OpenAI (GPT-4o), SEC/Yahoo APIs.

3. Backtest Factor Clinic (Quantitative)

View Repository
A modular clinic for validating investment factors before they touch live capital.

The "Alpha": Prevents overfitting by subjecting signals to regime changes, decay analysis, and transaction cost stress-tests.

Key Tech: Python (Pandas/NumPy), Vectorbt, Statistical Analysis.

🧬 AI Engineering & Ops (The "Model" Stack)

Infrastructure for creating, training, and vetting financial domain models.

4. Financial RLHF Studio (Data Engine)

View Repository
A "Human-in-the-Loop" labeling interface for capturing domain expertise to train financial LLMs.

The Workflow: Generates "Draft vs. Expert" pairs to create DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) datasets.

Goal: Solving the "Generic Finance" problem by capturing specific institutional nuance for fine-tuning.

5. Async Model Trainer (Infrastructure)

View Repository
A production-grade microservices architecture for scalable LLM fine-tuning.

The Architecture: Decouples the Control Plane (FastAPI/Streamlit) from the Compute Plane (GPU Workers) via a Redis message broker.

Key Tech: Celery (Async Queues), FastAPI, Unsloth (Llama-3 Optimization), Docker Compose.

6. Dynamic Thesis Vetter (Agentic RAG)

View Repository
An "Active Interviewer" agent that interrogates investment memos rather than just summarizing them.

The Workflow: Identifies logical gaps in a thesis -> Generates probing questions -> Searches the document to test robustness.

Key Tech: LangGraph (State Management), Advanced RAG, Dynamic Prompting.
